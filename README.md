# OhmPi

[![Build Status](https://gitlab.irstea.fr/%{project_path}/badges/%{default_branch}/pipeline.svg)](https://reversaal.gitlab.irstea.page/OhmPi)

Development of a low-cost multi-electrodes resistivity meter for electrical resistivity mesaurement for lab applications, based on raspberry board

## Installation

All dependencies are specified in *requirements.txt*

**Note:** all instructions below should be typed in the terminal

It is first necessary to create an OhmPi virtual environment and install all dependancies
`.create_ohmpi_virtual_envrinment.sh`

When the installation is completed check that requirements are met using 
`pip list`


We strongly recommend users to create a virtual environment to run the code and installed all required dependencies:
*  activate it using the following command:
   `source ohmpy/bin/activate`
*  you should run you code within the virtual environment
*  to leave the virtual environment simply type: `deactivate`

## First run with four electrodes

In the examples folder, you will find the code "simple_measurement.py".

Running this code, in Thonny (IDE) or in the terminal, will allow you to make a simple 4 electrodes measurement A B M N.
